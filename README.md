# Tech BrickS Excel Dashboard Project: Tracking Enrollments & Revenue Trends

## Tech BrickS Excel Dashboard

Welcome to the Tech BrickS GitHub repository for our recent project – **Understanding Enrollments & Revenue Trends with Excel Dashboard**. We've built an Excel dashboard that helps us make smarter decisions based on student enrollment and revenue patterns.

### What We Did
We gathered data, cleaned it up, transformed it, and turned it into visuals using Excel. This helped us see important trends that guide our decisions.

### Why Excel?
We could've used fancier tools, but we wanted to quickly explore the data. So, we used Excel to bring three years of data together and see the big picture.

### What We Found
We used charts and tables to see what's going on:

**• Courses of Interest:** Highlighting popular courses based on participant interest and enrollment.

**• Online Performance:** Probing the online platform's efficacy, especially during limited in-person classes.

**• Top Revenue Courses:** Showcasing courses generating the highest revenue.

**• Course Performance by Revenue:** Demonstrating each training course's revenue performance.

**• Tracking Trends:** Capturing participant enrollment and revenue trends over three years.

**• Mapping Revenue:** Graphing revenue distribution across different locations.

### What We Learned

**⮞ Insight 1: Popular Courses and Money**
We saw that Presentation, Access, and ISO 31000 courses were popular with 27% of students. But ISO 31000, ISO 14000, and ISO 50001 made the most money, even though they cost more. This means people see value in them. To get more students, we can offer discounts for these courses.

**⮞ Insight 2: Online vs. In-person**
More than half of students like online classes. But most money comes from in-person classes. We need to make sure online classes work well and keep our in-person classes good too.

**⮞ Insight 3: Money Changes Over Time**
From the middle of the second quarter to the end of the third quarter, we make the most money. We can use this time to offer deals on ISO and Presentation courses. After that, we should start a program to keep customers coming back.

**⮞ Geographical Insight: Good Places**
Ohio, Pennsylvania, and South Carolina are great places for us. We get about 9% of students and money from there. We can focus our marketing efforts there for better results.

### Our Goal
We turned data into plans. Our Excel dashboard is helping us make better choices for Tech BrickS. We're excited to improve our offerings and grow smarter using real data.
